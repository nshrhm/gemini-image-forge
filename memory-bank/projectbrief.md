**Core Requirements:**

*   Implement two primary scripts: `gemini_image_generator.py` and `gemini_image_transform.py`.
*   Ensure the scripts are user-friendly for novice users interested in generative AI.
*   Create a public GitHub repository named `gemini-image-forge` containing all project files.
*   Include a comprehensive README.md explaining the project and its usage.
*   Apply the MIT License to the project.
*   Document project-specific patterns and insights in a `.clinerules` file.

# Active Context: Gemini Image Forge

**Current Work Focus:**

*   Finalizing the initial upload of the `gemini-image-forge` project to GitHub.
*   Ensuring all necessary files are included in the repository (Python scripts, README, LICENSE, .gitignore).
*   Documenting project-specific patterns and insights in a `.clinerules` file.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Created `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE` files.
*   Initialized a Git repository and pushed the project to GitHub.
*   Created a `.clinerules` file to document project insights.
*   Created initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

**Next Steps:**

*   Review and refine the `.clinerules` file.
*   Explore potential enhancements to the Python scripts (e.g., error handling, input validation).
*   Consider adding more advanced features, such as image editing capabilities.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   Choosing appropriate project name and license.
*   Determining the target audience and tailoring the README accordingly.
*   Selecting the right technologies and dependencies for the project.

# Progress: Gemini Image Forge

**What works:**

*   The `gemini_image_generator.py` and `gemini_image_transform.py` scripts can generate and transform images using the Gemini API.
*   The project has been successfully uploaded to a public GitHub repository.
*   Basic documentation has been created in the README.md file.
*   A `.clinerules` file has been created to document project insights.
*   Initial memory bank files have been created.

**What's left to build:**

*   Enhancements to the Python scripts (e.g., error handling, input validation).
*   More advanced features, such as image editing capabilities.
*   More comprehensive documentation.

**Current status:**

The project is in its initial stages of development. The core functionality is working, but there is room for improvement in terms of features, documentation, and user experience.

**Known issues:**

*   The initial push to GitHub failed due to a mismatch between the local and remote branch names. This was resolved by renaming the local branch.
